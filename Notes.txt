Hi I just wanted to add a few notes to the project.

I simplfied some enviroment things in order to speed up the development.
The Web projects were hosted on Local IIS with a virtual directory.
I did this in order to simplify the development and avoid the implementation,
of CORS in WebAPI. However I did put some initial code to implement it , but
it's commented.

I've added some unit test to the project but not for all the projects , just 
for services. I used Moq , Xunit and Autofixer.

I just had time to add one frontend test. It test an Angular controller, and
it uses Karma , Jasmine, Angular Mocks . To use this test nodeJs need to be
present and node packages restored. I use node to test the frontend
because angular it's easier to test on it.

Thanks for your time.
